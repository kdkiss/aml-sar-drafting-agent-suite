## üöÄ Overview

An intelligent CrewAI-powered system that automates the analysis of suspicious financial activity and drafts comprehensive Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) that meet FinCEN regulatory requirements. This crew transforms complex transaction data into professional, submission-ready regulatory reports.

This crew enables financial institutions to streamline their AML compliance processes by leveraging a team of specialized AI agents that collaborate to analyze transactions, research regulations, draft narratives, and ensure quality compliance.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Analysis**: Four specialized agents (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Researcher, Narrative Drafter, Quality Reviewer) work together to ensure comprehensive SAR preparation
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Built-in knowledge of Bank Secrecy Act, FinCEN requirements, and current AML/CFT regulations with automatic compliance verification
- **Multiple SAR Types**: Supports structuring, trade-based money laundering, layering, check kiting, elder fraud, and other suspicious activity patterns
- **Baseline Comparison**: Custom tool compares transaction metrics against historical and peer baselines to identify anomalies
- **Enterprise Integration**: Trigger-based system for seamless integration with existing AML monitoring platforms
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive review process ensures accuracy, completeness, and regulatory compliance before submission

## üîç Use Cases

This crew is ideal for:

- **Financial Institutions** needing to automate SAR drafting and reduce compliance workload
- **AML Compliance Teams** looking to standardize and improve the quality of suspicious activity reporting
- **RegTech Companies** building comprehensive AML monitoring and reporting solutions
- **Credit Unions and Community Banks** requiring cost-effective compliance automation

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from crewai import Crew
from aml_sar_drafting_agent_suite.crew import AmlSarDraftingAgentSuite

# Initialize the crew
crew = AmlSarDraftingAgentSuite()

# Prepare your inputs
inputs = {
    'transaction_data': """
    Customer: John Smith (Account #123456)
    Transactions:
    - 2024-10-01: Deposit $9,500 cash
    - 2024-10-03: Deposit $9,800 cash
    - 2024-10-05: Wire transfer $19,000 to offshore account
    - 2024-10-08: Deposit $9,200 cash
    """,
    'customer_profile': """
    John Smith, 45, self-employed consultant
    Account opened: 2023-05-15
    Stated annual income: $60,000
    Previous activity: Average monthly deposits $3,000-5,000
    """,
    'alert_details': """
    Alert Type: Structuring / CTR Avoidance
    Alert Date: 2024-10-09
    Aggregated Cash Deposits (30 days): $38,500
    Number of Transactions: 5
    """,
    'activity_type': 'Structuring / CTR Avoidance'
}

# Run the crew
result = crew.kickoff(inputs=inputs)

# Access the results
print(result)
```

### Advanced Usage

```python
# Customize agent parameters
crew = AmlSarDraftingAgentSuite(
    verbose=True,
    memory=True,
    planning=True
)

# Run with specific configuration
result = crew.kickoff(
    inputs=inputs,
    output_log_file='sar_drafting_log.txt'
)

# Access individual task outputs
for task_output in result.tasks_output:
    print(f"Task: {task_output.description}")
    print(f"Output: {task_output.raw}")
```

## Input Requirements

The crew requires the following inputs:

- **transaction_data**: Detailed transaction information including dates, amounts, types, and parties
- **customer_profile**: Customer background, account history, and stated business/income
- **alert_details**: Alert information that triggered the SAR review
- **activity_type**: Type of suspicious activity (e.g., structuring, layering, trade-based laundering)

## Output

The crew produces:

1. **Transaction Analysis Report**: Detailed analysis of suspicious patterns and red flags
2. **Regulatory Compliance Brief**: Applicable regulations and filing requirements
3. **SAR Narrative**: Complete, submission-ready narrative
4. **Quality Assurance Review**: Final QA report saved to `sar_quality_review.md`

## Best Practices

1. **Provide Complete Data**: Include all relevant transaction details, customer information, and context
2. **Specify Activity Type**: Clearly identify the type of suspicious activity for targeted regulatory research
3. **Review Agent Outputs**: While the crew automates drafting, human oversight is essential for final submission
4. **Maintain Confidentiality**: Ensure all SAR data is handled according to confidentiality requirements
5. **Update Regularly**: Keep regulatory guidance and typologies current

## Compliance Note

This tool is designed to assist in SAR preparation but does not replace human judgment and expertise. All SARs must be reviewed by qualified compliance personnel before filing. Users are responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including the Bank Secrecy Act and FinCEN requirements.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Tool Usage Errors:**
- Ensure `current_metrics` parameter is provided as a dictionary with numeric values
- Verify baseline data exists in `data/baselines.json` for your customer

**Missing API Keys:**
