## Analysis of Patterns and Concerns

- **Transaction Patterns**: The rapid increase in volume and frequency of transactions within a short period indicates a sharp deviation from established historical behaviors.
- **Pricing and Documentation Anomalies**: Persistent over/under invoicing, pricing below market norms, and documentation inconsistencies (contained repeated reference numbers) suggest deliberate attempts to obscure the real value and origin of goods.
- **Geographic and Supplier Expansion**: Sudden engage with countries known for high-risk trading constitutes a significant shift from typical business pattern, increasing the risk of TBML.

## Conclusion and SAR Filing Consideration

The substantial and abrupt rise in transaction volume, supported by documentation anomalies and expansions to high-risk areas, strongly indicates potential trade-based money laundering activities. Given:

- A significant increase against both customer historical and peer norms,
- Document anomalies confirmed by invoice and weight inconsistencies,
- High-risk jurisdiction activity.

Such evidence supports filing a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR). 

**Recommendation**: Proceed with SAR filing for potential trade-based money laundering and engage in subsequent enhanced due diligence and auditing of Global Trade Solutions Inc.'s international trading operations.
