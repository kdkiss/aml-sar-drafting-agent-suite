# SAR Narrative: Dorothy Miller

## Subject and Institutional Relationship

**Subject:** Dorothy Miller  
**Account Number:** 654-321-0987  
**Institutional Relationship:** Dorothy Miller maintains a personal savings account with our financial institution. Historically, this account has had minimal wire transfer activity.

## Expected Baseline

Dorothy Miller's savings account, containing $185,000 before the evaluated period, typically exhibited low transaction volume, and no significant or frequent outgoing international wire transfers were noted for nearly 29 years. 

## Chronological Description of Activity

### November 2024

- **2024-11-03:** $15,000 transferred to Tech Support Solutions in Jamaica.
- **2024-11-05:** $8,500 sent to IRS Payment Center in Nigeria.
- **2024-11-08:** $12,000 to Lottery Processing Fee in Ghana.
- **2024-11-12:** $6,750 directed to Legal Fee Payment in the Philippines.
- **2024-11-15:** $18,000 sent towards an Investment Opportunity in Romania.
  
During early November, Dorothy began making frequent international wire transfers totaling $60,250. Her sudden engagement with global entities in high-risk jurisdictions contrasted sharply with her account's historical behavior.

### Late November 2024

- **2024-11-18:** $9,200 to Medical Emergency Fund in India.
- **2024-11-22:** $14,500 to Tax Resolution Service in Pakistan.
- **2024-11-25:** $7,800 for Charity Donation Processing in Kenya.
- **2024-11-29:** $16,200 sent for Romance Connection Fee in Russia.

This period showcased both increasing financial outlays and Dorothy's shifting engagement towards other risky jurisdictions. Her account was significantly depleted, totaling another outflow of $47,700.

### December 2024

- **2024-12-02:** $11,300 for Prize Claim Processing in Malaysia.
- **2024-12-05:** $8,900 sent for Computer Repair Service in Bangladesh.
- **2024-12-08:** $13,400 to Investment Recovery in Ukraine.
- **2024-12-12:** $10,600 towards Legal Settlement Fee in Morocco.

By December 12, Dorothy's account balance dwindled to $28,400 after an additional $44,200 in international transfers. Engagement seems to turn towards legally questionable services in highly notorious scam destination regions.

## Reason for SAR Filing

### Red Flags and Typologies

- **Magnitude and Velocity:** The high-velocity outflow amounting to $152,150 via 13 international transfers in 45 days depletes 85% of her savings.
- **Jurisdictional Risk:** All destinations, including Nigeria, Jamaica, Malaysia, and others, are known for high incidences of elder fraud and scams.

### Behavioral and External Observations

Bank staff reported Dorothy as consistently confused and displaying cognitive difficulty during multiple branch visits and phone interactions. Her behavioral presentation of distress coupled with family members' expressed concerns imply the potential for informed elder abuse or scam victimization.

### Deviations from History

The sudden emergence and volume of wire transfers represent an unprecedented deviation from Dorothy's historical baseline, implying coercion or exploitation.

## Typologies Supported by Evidence

The transaction patterns exhibit hallmarks of scams targeting elder individuals. This includes:

- **Tech Support and Government Impersonation Scams:** Transfers suggest involvement in fictive government or technical-related schemes as funds were wired to entities with misleading names.
- **Lottery and Romance Scams:** Significant funds directed at romantic and lottery-related fees demonstrate strong indicators of common elder financial exploitation types.

## Conclusion

**SAR Criteria Justification:**  
The extensive financial depletion, geographical engagement in high-risk locations, observed behavior indicative of cognitive decline, and external family intervention insights collectively necessitate a SAR filing. Dorothy's unusual transaction pattern, outside of normative behavior and sustained over a short period, aligns with elder financial exploitation.

## Recommendations

- **SAR Filing:** It is recommended to proceed with the SAR filing for elder financial abuse and scam victimization.
- **Protective Services Notification:** Notify adult protective services to provide safeguarding and support to Dorothy.
- **Family Coordination:** Communicate with Dorothy's family for additional intervention and protective measures.

By documenting these suspicious activities, our institution ensures adherence to regulatory compliance requirements and aims to safeguard Dorothy's remaining financial resources.
