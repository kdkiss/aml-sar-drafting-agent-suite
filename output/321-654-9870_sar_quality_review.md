# QA Report: SAR Narrative Review for Robert Thompson

## QA Determination: Fail

### Justification
Upon reviewing the draft SAR narrative for Robert Thompson's account activity, several issues prevent it from meeting the necessary criteria for submission. The narrative contains inaccuracies and lacks sufficient clarity on certain elements which are crucial for a well-substantiated SAR filing.

### Deficiencies Identified
1. **Inaccurate Date Range**: The analysis period stated as October 1, 2024 - November 15, 2024, does not consistently match the transaction dates listed. For example, some account activities reflect dates beyond the stated period.

2. **Amounts Not Reconciled**: The summary describes total incoming transfers of $800,000 and total outgoing of $791,900. However, adding individual transactions, the totals deviate by a small margin, affecting narrative accuracy.

3. **Missing Typology Explanation**: There's a mention of "layering strategy" as a typology indication without detailed exemplifying further. The narrative must explain how specific activities signify layering.

4. **Incomplete Five Elements of SAR**: The narrative mentions risk and outcomes broadly without including clear outcomes/results, account purpose verification, and less evident parties.

5. **Tone Issues**: Part of the narrative conveys conjectures rather than maintaining neutrality, particularly regarding customer profiles and jurisdictions.

### Fix or Enhancement Instructions
- **Correct Date Anomalies**: Ensure all transaction dates align with the analysis period and adjust the date range accordingly.
- **Reconcile Transaction Totals**: Double-check transaction values to ensure they accurately sum to the totals declared in the narrative.
- **Expand on Typologies**: Offer explicit examples of transaction patterns or interconnections that demonstrate layering, referencing specific transactions or behavioral indicators observed.
- **Complete Five Elements**: Ensure each narrative aspect presents: who, what, when, where, why – including customer purpose, source/destination relations, and further associations.
- **Revise Tone**: Use neutral, factual language, sticking only to transactions and behaviors without assumptions about intent or legality beyond noted indicators.

### Recommended Next Actions
The draft requires detailed revision to address identified omissions and strengthen narrative breadth reflective of compliance needs. Corrections as detailed should ensure the SAR aligns with FinCEN’s narrative expectations for reliable examiner utilization.

**Filing Readiness Recommendation**: Not ready for submission. Revisions are mandatory to ensure regulatory compliance and eliminate ambiguity affecting SAR utility.
