# Regulatory Compliance Brief: SAR Filing for Robert Thompson's Account Activity

## Applicable BSA/AML Rules

Financial institutions are required to adhere to the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and its regulations, including the requirement to file Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) to FinCEN. The key regulation for filing SARs is 31 CFR ยง 1020.320, which mandates reporting any known or suspected criminal violation or suspicious transaction relevant to a possible violation of law or regulation, including those perpetrated through money laundering activities.

### Key BSA Regulations:
- **31 CFR ยง 1020.320**: Requires banks to file SARs when they detect suspicious transactions that could signify money laundering or other illicit activities.
- **12 CFR ยง 748.1(d)**: Details the requirements for credit unions regarding SAR obligations.
- **FinCEN SAR Filing Requirements**: Emphasize adherence to electronic filing and proper formatting procedures.

## FinCEN SAR Filing Expectations

For activities such as layering and complex money movements, FinCEN advises that the SAR narrative must:
- Clearly and logically describe the nature and details of the suspicious activity.
- Include all relevant dates, amounts, and any identified patterns of activity.
- Explicitly state why the behavior is considered suspicious.
- Provide a comprehensive overview of any known parties involved and any prior interactions that might demonstrate rationale for suspicions.

## Applicable Typology and Red-Flag Guidance

### Money Laundering Typologies:
- **Layering Activities**: Characterized by rapid transactions, often using multiple accounts and jurisdictions to obscure origins of illicit funds.
- **Red Flags for Layering**: Include rapid movement of funds across various accounts in high-risk jurisdictions, use of shell companies, and numerous transactions fitting a structured pattern of deposits and withdrawals.

### Relevant Typologies: 
- FFIEC's BSA/AML Examination Manual highlights the use of complex, rapid transfers utilizing high-risk jurisdictions as indicative of layering.

### Regulatory Advisories:
- Recent enforcement actions have focused on the use of shell accounts and cross-border transactions to perform layering, increasingly scrutinizing jurisdictions with weak AML controls.

## Recent Regulatory Advisories or Enforcement Themes

Recent advisories by FinCEN emphasize vigilance surrounding transactions involving high-risk jurisdictions known for bank secrecy and financial crimes. The emphasis is on enhanced due diligence and scrutiny of entities associated with such jurisdictions to detect and prevent potential money laundering or terrorist financing activities.

## Required SAR Narrative Elements for This Case

Given Robert Thompson's transaction patterns, the SAR should include:
- Details of each transaction, including amounts, dates, and counterparties.
- Description of the account activity pattern, especially the use of jurisdictions known for financial secrecy.
- Clear articulation of discrepancies between stated account activity (as an investment consultant) and actual transaction volume.
- Any previous interaction with Robert Thompson that informs the decision to file a SAR.

---

In summary, the SAR for Robert Thompson's layering activities should succinctly capture the full scope of the suspicious activities detected, supported by the regulatory framework outlined under the BSA. It should further comply with FinCEN's SAR narrative guidelines to ensure full and timely compliance with federal regulations.
