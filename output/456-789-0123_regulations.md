# Regulatory Compliance Brief for Trade-Based Money Laundering (TBML) Suspicious Activity Report (SAR)

## Applicable BSA/AML Rules

This SAR filing concerning potential Trade-Based Money Laundering (TBML) for Global Trade Solutions Inc must adhere to several key Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)/Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations:

- **31 CFR § 1020.320 – Reports by banks of suspicious transactions**: This regulation requires banks to file a SAR when they identify any suspicious transaction relevant to a possible violation of law or regulation, especially those that seem indicative of money laundering activities involving $5,000 or more.
  
- **The FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual**: Asserts the requirement for financial institutions to have effective SAR monitoring systems to detect and report potential money laundering activities accurately.

## FinCEN SAR Filing Expectations

According to FinCEN suggestions and the guidance in the SAR form instructions:
- **Critical Narrative Section**: The narrative is essential as it encapsulates all relevant details that explain why the transaction is suspicious. This section should clearly articulate the nature of the suspicious activity and why it deviates from the customer's profile or baseline.

- **Specificity and Clarity**: Institutions must use clear and specific language to describe the activity. An indication of TBML should be explicitly mentioned, describing the trade discrepancies, invoicing issues, and geographic anomalies.

## Relevant Typology and Red-Flag Indicators

As per FinCEN advisories:
- **Over/Under-Invoicing**: This includes instances where invoice values do not align with the corresponding wire transfers.
  
- **Geographic Patterns**: Sudden activity involving high-risk jurisdictions is a critical indicator of TBML.

- **Cargo and Shipping Documentation**: Inconsistencies in shipping documentation such as repeated container numbers or mismatched shipping data.

## Recent Regulatory Advisories

Recent advisories by FinCEN related to TBML emphasize:
- **Enhanced Due Diligence**: Financial institutions should engage in thorough scrutiny of international trading entities operating beyond their typical geographic regions.
  
- **Red-Flag Awareness**: Awareness and training in identifying trade discrepancies and using shipping documentation to hide or reveal illicit trade patterns.

## Narrative Elements Required for TBML SAR

The narrative for this TBML SAR should include:
- **Description of Suspect Activity**: Clear articulation of the detected suspicious behavior, highlighting discrepancies in expected trade volumes versus actual, any anomalies in invoicing amounts, and relevant geographic considerations.
  
- **Detailed Trade Analysis**: Comprehensive description of red-flag indicators such as under/over-invoicing, discrepancy in shipping container weights, repeated container numbers, and any market price aberrations.
  
- **High-Risk Jurisdictions and New Supplier Analysis**: Emphasize the interaction with new suppliers from high-risk regions and their potential connection to TBML activities.

- **References to Regulatory Advisory**: Specifically refer to relevant FinCEN advisories and regulations in the narrative to strengthen the reporting foundation.
