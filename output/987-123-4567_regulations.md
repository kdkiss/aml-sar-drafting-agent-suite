# Regulatory Compliance Brief: SAR Filing for Check Kiting / Check Fraud

This regulatory compliance brief addresses the specific requirements and expectations for filing a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) in cases of check kiting and check fraud. Jennifer Walsh's account activity, evidenced by significant deviations in transactional patterns and financial behaviors, necessitates a SAR filing. Below is an exploration of the relevant regulatory obligations and expectations.

## BSA/AML Rules Applicable

- **31 CFR ยง1020.320**: This regulation mandates that financial institutions file a SAR if they have reason to suspect that a transaction involves funds derived from illegal activities, is intended to evade regulations, or lacks an apparent lawful purpose when aggregated amounts involve at least $5,000.
- **FFIEC BSA/AML Manual**: Stipulates best practices for identifying and reporting suspicious activities, such as check kiting, through risk management and transaction monitoring.

## FinCEN SAR Filing Expectations

The FinCEN SAR narrative guidance emphasizes the importance of providing detailed, clear, and concise descriptions of suspicious activity:
- **Describe the Nature of Suspicion**: Clearly articulate why the activity is considered suspicious, including indicators of check kiting such as orchestrated deposit and withdrawal patterns exploiting float periods.
- **Include Transaction Details**: Specify details including the dates, amounts, and nature of transactions that contributed to the suspicion.
- **Behavior Assessment**: Evaluate and document deviations from historical behaviors and industry norms, as Jennifer Walsh's account activity far exceeds her claimed income and past account behaviors.

## Typology and Red Flags

According to the **FFIEC's Red Flags Guidance**:
- **Frequent Deposits and Withdrawals**: Regular and significant check deposits with immediate withdrawals signal potential kiting schemes.
- **Returned Items**: High volumes of returned checks without historical precedent serve as a strong red flag for check fraud and kiting.
- **Unsubstantiated Increase in Activity**: A sudden increase in transaction volume that outpaces legitimate earning capacity or industry peers is indicative of fraudulent activity.

## Recent Regulatory Advisories

- **2024 National Money Laundering Risk Assessment**: Highlights the risks and typologies related to check fraud and emphasizes the need for robust transaction monitoring systems.
- **FinCEN Fraud Alerts**: Regular updates emphasize using data analytics in identifying patterns of check fraud and other financial crimes.

## Required Narrative Elements

In drafting the narrative for a SAR related to check kiting:
- **Clear Suspicious Indicators**: Explicitly list the actions and patterns observed, such as the frequency of deposits coinciding with same-day withdrawals.
- **Financial Discrepancy Analysis**: Analyze Jennifer Walsh's transactional behavior against her financial profile, highlighting unexplained income disparities.
- **Potential Mechanisms and Impact**: Assess the potential financial risk to the institution and any observed attempts to structure transactions to avoid detection.

## Conclusion

The analysis of Jennifer Walsh's account activities displays significant signs of check kiting and fraud, which are underscored by transactional anomalies and red-flag indicators. Filing a SAR, accompanied by a comprehensive narrative tailored to these observations and backed by regulatory insights, is crucial to meet compliance obligations and aid in the mitigation of financial and reputational risks for the institution.

This brief ensures that all relevant regulatory requirements are met, aligning the report with FinCEN's SAR narrative expectations and integrating insights from recent AML advisories and typologies.
