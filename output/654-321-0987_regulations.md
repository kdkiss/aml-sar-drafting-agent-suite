# Regulatory Compliance Brief: Elder Financial Abuse/Fraud Victimization

## Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Rules

- **31 U.S.C. ยง 5318(g)**: Requires financial institutions to report any known or suspected criminal violation or suspicious activity that might indicate money laundering, tax evasion, or other criminal activities.
- **31 CFR ยง 1020.320**: Mandates that banks file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) when detecting known or suspected violations of federal law or suspicious transactions related to money laundering activity.
- **BSA Requirements**: Financial institutions must implement AML programs and comply with SAR filing requirements to detect and report suspicious activities indicative of fraudulent activities, including elder financial exploitation.

## FinCEN SAR Filing Expectations

- **Elder Financial Exploitation Category**: FinCEN's SAR form includes a designated category for elder financial exploitation (EFE). Filers must provide detailed narratives on the suspicious activities observed.
- **Narrative Guidance**: Provide a clear, concise description of the transactions, why they are suspicious, and any patterns detected. Include identifiable details such as dates, amounts, involved parties, and methods used in carrying out suspected frauds.
- **Supporting Documentation**: Institutions are expected to maintain and provide access to all relevant documentation supporting SARs for review by FinCEN and applicable authorities.

## Relevant Typology and Red-Flag Guidance

- **High-Risk Jurisdictions**: Transactions to countries with high risks, such as Jamaica, Nigeria, and others, align with common elder scam typologies.
- **Fraud Typologies**: Identified scams include tech support fraud, government impersonation, lottery fraud, romance scams, and fictitious investment opportunities.
- **Behavioral Indicators**: Indications of confusion, cognitive decline, and external influence can be signs of financial coercion or exploitation tactics.

## Recent Regulatory Advisories

- **Interagency Statement on Elder Financial Exploitation (2024)**: Emphasizes the importance of detecting, preventing, and reporting elder financial exploitation. It encourages financial institutions to utilize their BSA/AML compliance programs to identify suspicious activities and report them via SARs.
- **NCUA and OCC Statements**: Support proactive engagement with law enforcement and adult protective services where elder financial exploitation is suspected.

## Required SAR Narrative Elements

- **Transaction Details**: Clearly document the sequence of transactions, including amounts, dates, and involved entities across the time window.
- **Observations and Patterns**: Specify observed changes in account behavior, deviations from historical patterns, and interactions suggestive of vulnerability or exploitation.
- **External Involvement**: Note any external communications or pressure reported by the account holder or observed by bank staff.
- **Family Concerns**: Include details of any family interventions or insights that heightened suspicion of financial abuse.

In conclusion, the SAR must articulate why Dorothy Miller's transaction patterns, geographical exposure, and behavioral changes led to the suspicion of elder financial abuse, prompting the SAR filing and potentially engaging additional protective steps.
