## Conclusion and Recommendation

The cumulative transactional behavior observed for Jennifer Walsh aligns with characteristics of check kiting and financial fraud due to evident exploitation of check float cycles synchronized with deposit and withdrawal transactions. This stark deviation from both Jennifer Walsh's historical financial behavior and the baselines associated with peer groups, when juxtaposed against her personal income declarations, substantiates the presumption of illicit activity. Suspension of account services and immediate SAR filing is recommended to forestall potential fraud consequences and facilitate investigative measures concerning the suspected kiting activities.
