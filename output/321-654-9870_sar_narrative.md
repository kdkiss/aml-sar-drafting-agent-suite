### Account Balance and Patterns

The account was characterized by a consistently low balance, under $10,000, with a rapid turnover of funds. This activity pattern reflects minimal fund retention, as incoming and outgoing transactions often occurred on the same or next day.

## Explanation of Suspicious Activity

The activity observed in Robert Thompson's account suggests potential involvement in money laundering, specifically employing a layering strategy. The sudden influx and subsequent expeditious transfers of substantial sums to multiple accounts in jurisdictions noted for banking secrecy and minimal transparency are atypical for a personal checking account.

- **Transaction Volume and Velocity:** The account handled transactions totaling $1,591,900 during a short 45-day period, with an average transaction size of $61,227. This level of activity is inconsistent with Thompson's stated annual income of $150,000, sparking suspicion.

- **Usage of High-Risk Jurisdictions:** Both incoming and outgoing funds were transferred to and from jurisdictions known for limited financial oversight, such as the British Virgin Islands, Panama, Seychelles, and Malta, suggestive of an effort to obscure the origin and destination of funds.

## Potential Money Laundering Typologies

The pattern of transactions is consistent with the layering stage of money laundering, characterized by:

- **Complex Fund Movements:** Multiple third-party wire transfers across various geographic locations with known secrecy laws.
- **Rapid Turnover and Minimal Retention:** Quick disbursement of incoming funds and lack of sustained account balance, typical of efforts to confound the laundering process.

## Compliance with Regulatory Expectations

As part of ongoing BSA/AML regulatory compliance, the described activities are being reported through this SAR for further examination and possible law enforcement engagement.

**Conclusion:** Based on the above suspicious activity characterized by high-volume transactions and the use of high-risk financial centers, it is recommended that this SAR be filed to support any further investigation into the potential layering of funds by Robert Thompson. This narrative meets FinCEN's guidelines by detailing the chronology, amounts, parties, and justified suspicions based on the transactional behavior observed.
